# Cross-Language Image Inference System with FastAPI, UVicorn, and C++ CLI Client

The **Cross-Language Image Inference System** achieves seamless integration of Python and C++ to deploy a trained deep learning model for image inference.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Python Server Setup**: The system utilizes the FastAPI web framework to create a Python server. UVicorn serves as the ASGI server to efficiently handle incoming HTTP requests. The server exposes an API endpoint to receive image data through POST requests.

    To start the server, open a terminal in the script's path and execute the following command:
    
    ```
    uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload
    ```

2. **C++ CLI Client**: A lightweight C++ CLI application is developed to interact with the Python server. The client prompts the user to input the path to an image file. It constructs an HTTP POST request, attaches the image data, and sends it to the Python server using the basic sockets library.

    Compile the cpp file to obtain an executable suitable for your OS, and then start it in the terminal. The program will prompt you for the image path.

3. **Image Processing and Inference**: Once the Python server receives the image data, it employs image processing techniques such as resizing. The processed image is then forwarded to a pre-trained deep learning model for inference. The model generates a prediction based on the image content.

4. **HTTP Response to C++ Client**: The Python server responds to the C++ client with an HTTP response containing the prediction generated by the machine learning model.

5. **Displaying Results**: The C++ CLI client parses the HTTP response and extracts the prediction. It subsequently displays the prediction to the user within the command-line interface.

## Project Benefits

This project underscores the power of cross-language communication by seamlessly integrating Python and C++ components. It highlights the versatility of FastAPI for building web APIs, UVicorn for server deployment, and sockets for making HTTP requests in C++. The resulting system provides users with a user-friendly CLI interface to submit images, retrieve predictions, and showcases the potential for creating robust multi-language applications for machine learning inference.
